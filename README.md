# Random Number Generator (1–100)

This Python script generates a random integer between 1 and 100. If the number is above 90, it prints a special “Lucky” message.

What I Learned
Understood that Math.random() is a pseudo‑random generator, not cryptographically secure.
Learned how to correctly scale its output to generate an inclusive range between 1 and 100.

Favorite Feature
Loved adding that “lucky message”—a special touch when the number is above 90. It was simple but instantly made the app feel more engaging.

Next Additions I’d Make
Let users set their own range (min & max inputs).
Display a history or chart of generated values for quick visual analysis.
Allow custom thresholded messages (e.g. above 50 shows “Nice!” or above 90 shows “Lucky!!”).
